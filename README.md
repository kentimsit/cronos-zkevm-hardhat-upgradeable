# Cronos zkEVM Hardhat project template for upgradeable contract

## Installation

Define Node version:

```bash
nvm use 20
```

This project was created by creating a standard hardhat project, and then migrating it to be compatible with ZK Stack using the instructions described in the ZK Sync documentation.

If you are using a project already created like this one, you can install it with `npm install`.

To write smart contracts, use the OpenZeppelin version supported by the dependencies ("@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.9.5‚Äù) and compiler. OpenZeppelin V5 is not supported.

## Compile and test contracts

The frequently used shell commands are:

```bash
# Compile all smart contracts
npx hardhat compile
# Run tests
npx hardhat test
# Check test coverage (this may throw errors)
npx hardhat coverage
```

## Deploy a smart contract directly on L2 (Cronos zkEVM Testnet)

To deploy a smart contract to Cronos zkEVM Testnet, select `cronosZkevmSepoliaTestnet` as the `defaultNetwork` in `hardhat.config.ts`.

The frequently used shell commands are:

```bash
# Deploy on Cronos zkEVM Testnet
npx hardhat run ./deploy/deploy.ts
